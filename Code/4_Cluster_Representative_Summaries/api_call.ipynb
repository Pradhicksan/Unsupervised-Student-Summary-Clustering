      "the lecture began with a review of expectation algebra, standard-error calculation using a single sample, and histogram-bin-width determination, emphasizing that the number of bins depends on the desired level of detail in data-analysis.  the relationship between the sample-variance and population-variance was also clarified.  next, the class moved on to logistic-regression, a binary-classification method using a sigmoid-function to map input-features to probabilities (p(y|x)).  the logistic-unit outputs a probability score; if the probability exceeds 0.5, the observation is classified as belonging to class 1; otherwise, class 0. the goal of logistic-regression is to maximize the likelihood of correctly predicting class-labels, achieved by adjusting weights (wi) to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities (p) and actual class-labels (t).  this is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss-function, often done using gradient-descent.  the choice of a linear or non-linear decision-boundary was also discussed, with a caution against overfitting when choosing a highly flexible model.  model-evaluation metrics were introduced, including the confusion-matrix (true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives, false-negatives), accuracy, precision, recall, and the f1-score (the harmonic-mean of precision and recall).  the limitations of relying solely on accuracy, especially with imbalanced-datasets, were highlighted, making the f1-score a more robust metric.  the session concluded with a teaching-assistant review of assignment e1, focusing on common errors such as misinterpreting the kurtosis-function in excel and incorrect model-comparisons.  students were reminded of the importance of submitting well-documented excel-files with clear formulas and calculations.  clustering was mentioned as a technique to group similar data points, potentially improving classification performance before applying logistic regression.  outlier-detection techniques were also briefly introduced for identifying rare data points that might skew the results.  softmax-function was mentioned as a method for assigning probabilities to multiple classes in a classification problem.  the use of two different models for fitting the same dataset was discouraged due to potential discontinuities at the boundary between the models.\n",
