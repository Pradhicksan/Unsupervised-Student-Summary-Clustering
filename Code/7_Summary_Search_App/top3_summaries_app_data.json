            "9": "the lecture began with a recap of confidence intervals. using an example, we analyzed points a and b within the confidence interval range to determine whether they were truly distinct or if their values appeared by chance. another point, d, which was outside the confidence interval, was identified as statistically significant. since the probability of obtaining d from the sample was very low, we concluded that it was statistically different from a and b.  \n\nnext, we introduced embedding vectors as a way to process data. we converted data into vectors that included various features, allowing for feature engineering.  \n\nfollowing this, we discussed multiple linear regression (mlr). the objective of mlr is to express a dependent variable (y) as a linear combination of independent features (xâ‚, xâ‚‚, xâ‚ƒ, ...). like simple linear regression, mlr aims to minimize the sum of squared errors to determine the best-fit coefficients for the features in the model.  \n\nthe lecture then covered the matrices used in the derivation of mlr and the cost function which helps quantify the error. the gradient descent process was then introduced to optimize the model parameters.  \n\nwe also discussed the f-value, calculated as the mean square regression (msr) divided by the mean square error (mse). a higher f-value indicates a better model fit.  \n\nnext, we explored the role of the p-value in multiple linear regression. if a feature's p-value is greater than 0.05, it suggests that zero falls within the confidence interval, meaning that the feature is not statistically significant. based on this, we learned that features with high p-values can be dropped from the model, as their presence does not significantly impact the predictions. features with the highest p-values are the least significant and should be removed to improve the model's efficiency.
