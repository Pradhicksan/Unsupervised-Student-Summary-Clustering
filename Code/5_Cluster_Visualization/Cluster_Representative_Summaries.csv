1,"the class focused on exploratory-data-analysis (eda) using excel pivot-tables.  pivot-tables were used to analyze summary-submission data, calculating descriptive-statistics like mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard-deviation of character-counts, submission-frequency, and changes in summary-length over time.  histograms, box-plots, and scatter-plots were used to visualize data-distribution and identify outliers.  eda was then applied to chemical-plant data, revealing missing data points (represented by zero minimum values) and requiring anomaly-detection.  further analysis included calculating mean, median, mode, kurtosis, and skewness,  and creating correlation-heatmaps.  principal-component-analysis (pca) reduced 240 columns to 17 principal-components.  a transformer-operation dataset was also examined, focusing on identifying anomalies and addressing issues like class-imbalance and sensor-failure.  the teaching-assistant provided feedback on exercise-e2, emphasizing proper file-naming, accurate plots with titles and legends, submission in .xlsx format, proper-formatting, providing examples when requested, using spreadsheets when required, performing correct calculations including residual-diagnostics and discussing all metrics (not just r-square), creating datasets with large variance, plotting rmse, f-statistic, r-square versus standard-deviation, and including confidence-intervals.  feature-engineering and data-transformation methods were briefly discussed for improving data-quality.  the importance of documenting findings, including visualizations and narratives, and asking clarifying questions about data generation was also highlighted.
"
5,"the class began by analyzing summary-submission trends, revealing decreasing submissions but increasing average-word-counts per summary.  polynomial-regression was then illustrated using a sine-curve-like function, initially with feature x1 and engineered-features x1², x1³, x1⁴. adding sin(x1) resulted in a lower p-value, indicating significance. however, excessive feature-addition diminishes adjusted-r²-values.  a single-model is preferable to multiple models if it sufficiently represents the data. parametric-methods like neural-networks were discussed, highlighting input-layers, computational-layers (deep-learning with multiple layers), and the risk of overfitting due to increased degrees-of-freedom. three-ways to improve results were identified: sample-improvement (quality and size), method-improvement (multiple-method comparison), and method-fine-tuning.  linear-regression was defined as expressing the outcome as a linear-combination of independent-variables, potentially non-linear themselves. polynomial-regression uses feature-engineering to add polynomial and trigonometric-functions, like sin(x) and xⁿ, to model non-linear relationships.  backward and forward feature-selection were discussed, along with overfitting issues. the choice between a single versus multiple models was debated, with a single model favored for ease of implementation and reduced cost of ownership. random-forest was highlighted as a method that naturally combines multiple models. parametric and non-parametric models, delta-analysis, and neural-networks were briefly reviewed.  neural networks, including deep-learning models, were explained, along with their data requirements and the risk of overfitting. logistic-regression and classification were introduced, focusing on predicting class-labels for nominal and ordinal data.  the sigmoid-function, weights, and the concept of defining decision-boundaries were explained.  taylor-series expansion was mentioned as a way to represent any function as a sum of powers of x, enabling fitting non-linear curves using multiple-linear-regression.  the adjusted-r²-value's decrease with unnecessary-feature addition was noted.  feature-selection methods—forward and backward engineering—were detailed.   model-selection involves exploratory-data-analysis (eda) and comparison of multiple-models, selecting the best based on metrics like r²-square, mean-square-error (mse), and model-interpretability. the importance of balancing model-complexity and prediction-accuracy, particularly avoiding overfitting, was emphasized. parametric-models, like linear-regression, enable delta-analysis, allowing for 'what-if' scenarios, while non-parametric-models like random-forest, xgboost, and k-nearest-neighbors (knn), offer flexibility but may lack explainability.  logistic-regression, a classification-technique using the sigmoid-function to define decision-boundaries, and reduce misclassification, was introduced.  the sigmoid-function maps inputs to probabilities between 0 and 1, facilitating class-prediction.
"
6,"heatmaps provide pairwise-analysis of multiple-parameters but lack detailed information. variance-inflation-factor (vif) identifies multicollinearity by regressing each-parameter against others; high vif values (above a threshold, for example, 10) indicate redundancy and necessitate feature-removal.  principal-component-analysis (pca), using singular-value-decomposition, transforms correlated-features into orthogonal principal-components (pcs).  the number of pcs equals the original-dimensionality, but only those explaining sufficient variance (for example, 95% confidence-interval, determined via elbow-diagram) are retained.  pcs are weighted-sums of original-features, with weights called loadings. pca facilitates dimension-reduction, prediction-models, and visualization (exploratory-data-analysis-eda), but hinders interpretability and sensitivity-analysis because pcs are not real-world-parameters.  data-normalization is crucial before pca.  vif should precede pca as multicollinearity is a more significant issue than dimensionality. t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding (t-sne) is a stochastic, lossy dimension-reduction technique using t-distribution and gradient-descent to visualize high-dimensional-data by preserving local-structure;  it is computationally-intensive and its results vary.  a comparison between gaussian and t-distribution highlights t-sne's advantage in representing distant-points.  there is a trade-off between r-square and vif; excessive feature-reduction to lower vif can negatively impact r-square and prediction-model performance.  pca facilitates dimension-reduction, prediction-models, and visualization in eda but does not allow for sensitivity-analysis;  it is sensitive to data-scaling and requires normalization.  t-sne maps high-dimensional data to lower dimensions (typically 2d or 3d) using a probabilistic approach, preserving local structure but sacrificing exactness.
"
9,"the class covered feature-encoding techniques for preparing categorical and textual data for machine-learning models.  initial discussions included vectorization, a general approach for transforming data into numerical vectors, and one-hot-encoding, which converts categorical variables into binary vectors, suitable for multiclass and multilabel-classification problems but prone to curse-of-dimensionality with many categories. label-encoding assigns unique integers, implying an ordinal relationship, while integer-encoding is suitable for ordinal data preserving order. binary-encoding (compact-encoding) efficiently represents categories using fewer columns, mitigating dimensionality issues. frequency-encoding assigns numerical values based on category frequency, and target-encoding uses the mean target-value for each category, capturing relationships between categories and the outcome. textual-data conversion to numerical vectors through vectorization was briefly introduced.  the course plan, assignments, and a group-project were also discussed.  t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) was mentioned for visualizing high-dimensional data but deemed unsuitable for predictive modeling due to its stochastic nature. principal component analysis (pca) was presented as an alternative for dimensionality reduction, particularly effective with continuous numerical data.  different classification problems were examined: multiclass-classification, where the output belongs to one of many classes, and multilabel-classification, where the output can belong to multiple classes.  alternatives to one-hot-encoding, such as binary-encoding, frequency-encoding (applied only to input variables, x, not the target variable, y), and target-encoding (mean-encoding, which may introduce data-leakage), were explored. feature-binning, a technique for converting continuous features into categorical features to use classification models instead of regression models, was also addressed.  text-processing, specifically converting text into numerical representations using methods like stop-word removal and dictionary creation, was introduced. the choice of encoding method depends on data type (nominal, ordinal), variable role (feature or target), and dimensionality considerations.  various encoding techniques have strengths and weaknesses, and selecting the correct method is crucial for model efficiency and effectiveness.
"
11,"the class began with a review of gradient descent and an introduction to logistic-regression.  a demonstration using playground.tensorflow.org illustrated neural-network classification, highlighting the impact of feature-selection and hidden-layer complexity on model performance.  logistic-regression model evaluation was discussed, emphasizing that accuracy alone is insufficient;  the confusion-matrix, precision, recall, and f1-score provide more comprehensive assessments.  the receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (roc-curve), plotting true-positive-rate (tpr) against false-positive-rate (fpr), and its area-under-the-curve (auc) were introduced as key metrics for classifier quality, with auc values near 1 indicating superior classification.  data-imbalance, particularly relevant in fraud-detection, was discussed, highlighting its impact on model performance and the limitations of accuracy as a sole metric.  converting regression problems to classification problems using binning was also covered. the class then transitioned to clustering, an unsupervised-learning technique.  k-means-clustering, requiring pre-specified cluster numbers, and hierarchical-clustering, which generates a dendrogram to visualize cluster relationships without needing to pre-define the number of clusters, were both explained.  various linkage methods for hierarchical-clustering were mentioned.  the class also discussed the use of clustering in exploratory-data-analysis (eda) and touched on clustering evaluation metrics like the silhouette-score.  finally, the importance of feature-engineering and data-transformations in improving classification performance was noted.
"
100,"the class began with a review of the mid-semester exam, including a detailed walkthrough of the solution by the professor and clarifying key concepts.  the teaching assistant (ta) then provided feedback on assignment 3, noting an improvement in overall report quality.  a brief discussion on data-problem flowcharts concluded this section.  the mid-semester exam solution involved exploratory-data-analysis (eda), including handling missing values (either dropping rows with few missing values or imputation using mean or median), outlier-detection (using box-plots), and data-normalization.  the analysis revealed no need for clustering due to numerous parameters. a correlation-matrix indicated only six truly-independent parameters. the model built for the first part of the exam was inapplicable to the second part due to different populations, as evidenced by differing kernel-density-estimation (kde) plots and descriptive-statistics.  the ta also reviewed assignment 3.  the curse-of-dimensionality was introduced, explaining how high-dimensionality leads to increased sparsity, complexity, and computational cost, along with distance-distortion.  the variance-inflation-factor (vif) versus r-square graph was discussed, and vif was explained as a measure of multicollinearity; high vif values indicate strong collinearity among features.  handling class-imbalance, specifically the under-representation of heart-disease cases, was also addressed; oversampling was considered but not implemented due to extreme class-imbalance.  the importance of feature-selection and dimensionality-reduction were highlighted as methods to address the curse-of-dimensionality.  various data-analysis techniques were covered including kde-plots, range-checks, missing-value-imputation, and box-plots for outlier-detection.  principal-component-analysis (pca) and the use of a heatmap to visualize correlations were also discussed, but it was emphasized that a heatmap only accounts for pairwise relationships and does not fully address multicollinearity.  to detect multicollinearity, the variance-inflation-factor (vif) was introduced, calculated using r-square values obtained by regressing each feature on all others.  a high vif value (above a threshold, often 10) indicates that a feature can be expressed as a linear combination of others and should be considered for removal.  the iterative process of removing high-vif features to improve model stability was explained.  the session also covered different performance-evaluation methods, including confusion-matrices and precision-recall curves.  the limitations of using only pairwise correlation measures (like a heatmap) were highlighted; multicollinearity necessitates more advanced techniques like vif calculations.  different model-selection considerations, such as data-type and problem type, were addressed; the appropriateness of tree-based models, support-vector-machines (svm), and logistic-regression were discussed. feature-transformation and feature-scaling were also emphasized, especially for models sensitive to feature-magnitude.  the under-representation of a target class and its effect on prediction accuracy were discussed, along with potential remedies like resampling techniques or using appropriate evaluation metrics.  imputation methods were discussed, highlighting the need to consider the data's distribution before choosing a strategy, suggesting dropping rows if the number of missing values is small.  the choice of prediction model was linked to the data-type and the nature of the problem, with tree-based models being mentioned as suitable for non-linear data and robustness to outliers.  the importance of understanding data distributions (using kde-plots) for comparing different datasets and assessing model generalizability was emphasized.  the difference between the datasets used in the two parts of the mid-semester exam, and how that impacted the model's performance, was highlighted. the use of chatgpt in code writing was mentioned, but not in solution design.  the need to justify all assumptions and steps in the analysis was also stressed.  the class also covered data-distribution-mismatches between training and validation data, showing that model performance can be severely impacted by differences in underlying populations.
"
101,"the class covered population-parameter estimation using sample-means, focusing on mean and variance calculations.  a central-limit-theorem example using a sample of 18 manager-overtime observations illustrated sample-mean probability-density-function plotting.  confidence-intervals were introduced, employing t-distributions for sample-sizes under 30, highlighting their real-world decision-making utility.  t-values, z-values, and the concept of statistically-different results were explained.  p-values and multiple-linear-regression were introduced, with p-values under 0.05 indicating statistically-significant coefficients in linear-regression models (y=b0+b1x).  anova was presented as a tool for comparing multiple-means, using the f-statistic (msr/mse) to assess overall model-significance.  sample-error was defined as sigma/root n, with sigma approximated by sample-sigma.  histograms of sample-frequency-distributions were discussed, normalizing to unity and smoothing with reduced bin-size.  95% confidence-intervals and t-distributions were revisited.  multiple-linear-regression using anova was re-introduced.  regression-metrics (sse, mse, rmse, mae, r-squared) were explained as measures of linear-regression model-accuracy, measuring data-variation. the central-limit-theorem was emphasized, stating that repeated sampling yields normally-distributed sample-means, enabling statistical-inference.  feature-engineering was highlighted as crucial for improved classifier-performance.  standard-error, representing the sample-mean's sampling-distribution standard-deviation, was covered, distinguishing its calculation when population-standard-deviation is known (s/√n) versus unknown (sample-size<30 using t-distribution).  z-statistic and t-statistic were discussed as test-statistics for normal and t-distributions respectively, with p-values explaining the probability of a regression-coefficient being zero by chance.  statistical-equivalence of values within a confidence-interval was explained, showing that regression is not valid if β1 is statistically-equivalent-to zero. multiple-linear-regression and anova (comparing multiple-averages) were discussed, with the f-statistic defined as msr/mse.  the relationship between p-values and confidence-intervals was detailed.  population-mean estimation from single and multiple samples was detailed, utilizing confidence-intervals and the standard-error-of-the-mean formula (µ=σ/√n).  the formation of normally-distributed sample-means from multiple-samples was discussed, with probabilities expressed via p-values. linear-regression coefficients (β0 and β1) were calculated.  the anova table was explained as a method for comparing multiple sample means.  the normality of sampling-distributions was stressed, regardless of original-population-distribution (for sufficiently-large samples).  the assumptions of linear regression, specifically normally-distributed errors, and consequences of non-normality and predictive-error were discussed.  stepwise population-mean estimation (sample-mean calculation, sample-standard-deviation approximation for population-standard-deviation, standard-error calculation, confidence-interval determination) was presented. t-distributions were emphasized for sample-sizes less than 30. the interpretation of p-values and confidence-intervals was explored in the context of linear-regression coefficient significance. the impact of sample-size on standard-error, confidence-interval width, and the reliability of regression-analysis was explained.  the relationship between p-values and confidence-intervals was reviewed.  multiple-linear-regression, and anova,  were covered, particularly the f-statistic (msr/mse) for evaluating model-significance.  sample-statistics (mean, variance), sample-mean estimation and hypothesis-testing, using p-values and  t-tests(for n<30), normal and t-distributions, were explained. confidence-intervals and their significance in assessing population-mean uncertainty were emphasized. the use of p-values in regression-analysis to assess coefficient significance was clarified, particularly the role of p-values below 0.05 in validating regression models.  multiple-linear-regression and anova, including the interpretation of the f-statistic, were explained.  the impact of sample-size on the precision of estimations was outlined.  error-analysis in regression models and their impact on model-validity was discussed.  the three steps for estimating population-mean from a sample (sample-mean calculation, sample-standard-deviation approximation, standard-error calculation) were given. normal and t-distributions were discussed, including their differences and when each is applicable.  the importance of using p-values and confidence-intervals to check regression-coefficient significance and how it affects the regression-model validity were explained.
"
102,"the lecture began by differentiating population-parameters and sample-statistics, emphasizing the importance of a representative sample for accurate population-estimation.  key descriptive-statistics—count-frequency, mode, median, mean, standard-deviation, variance—and their associated operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) were reviewed, categorized by level-of-measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).  simple-linear-regression (slr) was introduced as a method to model the relationship between a single-predictor (independent) variable (x) and a dependent-variable (y) using the equation y=b₀+b₁x, where b₀ represents bias (the influence of unaccounted-for variables) and b₁ represents slope.  a point-model, although naive, was also considered as a potential model.  different samples yield different slr-models with varying b₀ and b₁ point-estimates;  therefore, confidence-intervals around these estimates are necessary for reliable population-parameter estimation.  the best-fit line in slr is determined by minimizing the sum-of-squared-errors (sse), as opposed to the sum-of-errors (which can be zero due to cancellation of positive and negative errors) or the sum-of-absolute-errors (which has a diamond-shaped sphere-of-influence, leading to bias), because sse magnifies larger errors and does not differentiate between positive and negative errors (circular sphere-of-influence).  closed-form solutions for b₀ and b₁ were derived using partial-differentiation to minimize sse; notably, the mean of x and y always lies on the best-fit line.  the derived b₀ and b₁ values are point-estimates with zero-confidence, highlighting the need for confidence-intervals to quantify the likelihood that the true population-parameters fall within a given range.  increasing the interval-size increases confidence; a 100%-confidence-interval spans from negative-infinity to positive-infinity.  the goal is to estimate population-parameters (b₀p and b₁p) using sample-statistics (b₀ and b₁), which improve in accuracy with increasing sample-size.  the lecture concluded with a re-emphasis on the importance of good-data and representative-samples for reliable model-building.
"
103,"the class began with an excel-based session on simple-linear-regression, calculating beta0, beta1, y-cap, and error-values.  the limitations of predicting data-points beyond the regression-line due to sample-constraints were discussed, emphasizing the importance of assessing model-quality by analyzing the randomness of error-distribution. a histogram was introduced, along with the criteria for determining whether an error-distribution is random (it should follow a normal/gaussian-distribution due to the error's dependence on many unknown variables). the data-analysis-toolpack in excel was utilized.  the coefficient-of-determination (r-square) was defined; for simple-linear-regression, it equals the square of the correlation-coefficient (r) between x and y, a relationship that does not hold true for multiple-linear-regression. the central-limit-theorem was derived. scatter-plots and histograms of x, y, and error-values were created in excel.  a non-linear-data example illustrated a poor model fit, showing a pattern in the error-values’ scatter-plot. the data-analysis-toolpack generated summary-output including r-square, p-value, and other regression-metrics.  a good model explains data-variation, with total-variation (sst) equaling the sum of regression-explained variation (ssr) and unexplained-variation (sse). r-square is calculated as ssr/sst. positive and negative correlations were defined. the central-limit-theorem states that sample-means follow a normal-distribution with standard-error equal to the population-standard-deviation divided by the square-root of the sample-size.  error-metrics including sse, mse, rmse, and mae were used to assess model-performance. regression-coefficients are sample-estimates of population-parameters. sampling-distributions of sample-means were discussed, demonstrating their tendency towards a normal-distribution with decreasing standard-error for larger sample-sizes.  the data-analysis-toolpack's output (confidence-interval, r-square, standard-error, etc.) was interpreted. the relationship between standard-deviation and variance, and the relationship between population-standard-deviation and sample-standard-deviation (sigma/sqrt(n)) were explained.  analysis-of-variance (anova) and the f-statistic were introduced.  sst, ssr, and sse were defined as measures of total-variation, regression-explained-variation, and unexplained-variation, respectively, with sst = ssr + sse.  the concept of sampling-distributions, where means of multiple representative samples form a normal-distribution (central-limit-theorem), and its application in calculating confidence-intervals was covered.  larger sample-sizes lead to smaller standard-errors and improved precision.  the p-value and its use in feature-selection were discussed in the context of multiple-linear-regression.  time-series-analysis was suggested for predictions outside the observed data-range.  a good model is one that explains most of the data-variation and displays random, gaussian-distributed errors.  simple-linear-regression implementation in excel was detailed, including manual calculations and utilization of excel’s data-analysis-toolpak.  the interpretation of regression-statistics (multiple-r, r-square, adjusted-r-square, standard-error, confidence-intervals, p-values, t-values, anova-table values, f-statistic) was covered.  the concept of a sampling-distribution and its relation to the central-limit-theorem was explained.  multiple-linear-regression was briefly introduced.
"
104,"the core concept in machine learning is represented by the equation y=f(x), where y represents labels and x represents features (a vector of multiple entities). traditionally, the function f was determined manually through curve-fitting; however, machine learning employs algorithms like simple-linear-regression, multiple-linear-regression, logistic-regression, and random-forest (supervised-learning techniques) and k-means-clustering and hierarchical-clustering (unsupervised-learning methods) to empirically determine f.  data is categorized into four levels of measurement: nominal (discrete, categorical, example: gender), ordinal (discrete, ordered categories, example: grades), interval (continuous, arbitrary zero, example: temperature), and ratio (continuous, fixed zero, example: height).  nominal and ordinal data are suitable for classification tasks, while interval and ratio data are suitable for regression tasks.  one-hot-encoding (ohe) is used to represent nominal data as vectors to avoid implying an incorrect order when using numerical representations. supervised-learning methods are used when both labels and features are available, while unsupervised-learning methods are used when only features are available.  in unsupervised learning, clustering techniques like k-means-clustering and hierarchical-clustering are employed to group data and potentially assign labels.  data analysis is typically performed on a sample—a representative subset of the population—due to computational limitations, even with vast datasets available.  the larger the sample size (relative to the population), the more accurate the predictions.  the accuracy of a model needs to be verified through testing.  interval and ratio data types are continuous, while nominal and ordinal data types are discrete.  the choice of machine learning algorithm depends on whether the problem is classification or regression and whether it is supervised or unsupervised.
"
105,"the lecture covered data-science problem-solving using the crisp-dm-framework, a six-step cyclical process: business-understanding, data-understanding, data-preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.  data-understanding involves exploratory-data-analysis (eda), including visualization techniques like histograms, box-plots, matrix-plots, and correlation-heatmaps to identify data-distributions, outliers, and inter-feature-relationships.  eda also addresses class-imbalance and helps understand data-trends.  data-preparation focuses on handling missing-data (mcar, mar, mnar types), using univariate-methods (deletion, mean/median/mode imputation) and multivariate-methods (knn, mice, regression-models). outlier-handling involves univariate-approaches (isolation-forest, iqr-based-methods) and multivariate-approaches (dbscan), considering the median as a more robust measure than the mean.  data-smoothening techniques, such as simple-moving-average (sma) and exponential-moving-average (ema), reduce noise and highlight trends.  data-scaling methods, including normalization (0-1 range) and standardization (mean 0, variance 1), are applied to address feature-scaling issues, especially for algorithms sensitive to euclidean-distance like k-means-clustering. transformations like box-cox and log-transformations are used to achieve normality and handle heteroscedasticity (varying variance).  data-imbalance is addressed using techniques like oversampling (smote), undersampling (tomek-links), and synthetic-data-generation. the confusion-matrix is used for multi-class-classification-evaluation, emphasizing the importance of correctly identifying actual versus predicted values.  the lecture stressed the iterative nature of the crisp-dm-process and the importance of domain-knowledge in choosing appropriate eda-techniques and handling outliers.  the mid-term exam will focus on conceptual understanding, eda, and visualization, not derivations.
"
106,"the lecture began with a review of expectation algebra, standard-error calculation using a single sample, and histogram-bin-width determination, emphasizing that the number of bins depends on the desired level of detail in data-analysis.  the relationship between the sample-variance and population-variance was also clarified.  next, the class moved on to logistic-regression, a binary-classification method using a sigmoid-function to map input-features to probabilities (p(y|x)).  the logistic-unit outputs a probability score; if the probability exceeds 0.5, the observation is classified as belonging to class 1; otherwise, class 0. the goal of logistic-regression is to maximize the likelihood of correctly predicting class-labels, achieved by adjusting weights (wi) to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities (p) and actual class-labels (t).  this is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss-function, often done using gradient-descent.  the choice of a linear or non-linear decision-boundary was also discussed, with a caution against overfitting when choosing a highly flexible model.  model-evaluation metrics were introduced, including the confusion-matrix (true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives, false-negatives), accuracy, precision, recall, and the f1-score (the harmonic-mean of precision and recall).  the limitations of relying solely on accuracy, especially with imbalanced-datasets, were highlighted, making the f1-score a more robust metric.  the session concluded with a teaching-assistant review of assignment e1, focusing on common errors such as misinterpreting the kurtosis-function in excel and incorrect model-comparisons.  students were reminded of the importance of submitting well-documented excel-files with clear formulas and calculations.  clustering was mentioned as a technique to group similar data points, potentially improving classification performance before applying logistic regression.  outlier-detection techniques were also briefly introduced for identifying rare data points that might skew the results.  softmax-function was mentioned as a method for assigning probabilities to multiple classes in a classification problem.  the use of two different models for fitting the same dataset was discouraged due to potential discontinuities at the boundary between the models.
"
107,"the lecture began with a review of statistical-significance and the distinction between statistically-significant and statistically-similar values, illustrated using confidence-intervals.  a point outside the confidence-interval was identified as statistically-significant due to its low probability of occurrence.  embedding-vectors were introduced as a method for processing data by converting it into vectors containing various features, enabling feature-engineering.  multiple-linear-regression (mlr) was then introduced, aiming to express a dependent-variable (y) as a linear-combination of independent-features (x1, x2, x3...).  mlr, like simple-linear-regression, minimizes the sum-of-squared-errors to determine optimal coefficients. the matrices used in mlr derivation and the cost-function were discussed, along with the gradient-descent method for optimizing model-parameters. the f-statistic (msr/mse), indicating model-fit, was explained; a higher f-statistic suggests a better fit. p-values were also discussed in the context of mlr; a p-value greater than 0.05 indicates a feature is not statistically-significant and can be dropped from the model, starting with the feature possessing the highest p-value.  the process of feature-selection, improving model-efficiency by removing insignificant features, was detailed.  data-science algorithms analyzing session-summaries using a relative-strength-approach, calculating distances based on scatter-plot-coefficients, were also discussed.  students were assigned python tutorials in preparation for the next class.  in mlr, there is no closed-form solution; therefore, numerical methods like gradient-descent, analogous to the newton-raphson method, are employed.  model-evaluation considers error-metrics (mse, rmse, mae), p-values for statistical-significance, and the f-statistic for comparing models.  rmse and mae, having the same units as the data, are easier to interpret than mse and sse, which are primarily used for optimization.  r-squared increases with the number of independent-variables, necessitating adjusted-r-squared for accurate variance assessment.  feature-engineering, creating new features from existing ones, was explained with examples.  the adjusted-r-squared formula was also provided: adjusted-r-squared = 1 - ((ssr/(n-k-1))/(sst/(n-1))).  the quantile-quantile (qq)-plot assesses the normality of the error-distribution; an ideal plot shows y=x.  data-science algorithms, such as those used to analyze session-summaries using a relative-strength method based on scatter-plot coefficients, were discussed.  the use of training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets in model training and evaluation was highlighted, along with the importance of adjusted-r-squared to avoid overfitting.  multiple-linear regression in matrix form was presented: y = xb + e. the concept of multicollinearity, leading to a non-invertible (x<sup>t</sup>x) matrix, was explained, preventing the calculation of  β̂.  additional statistical tests such as aic, bic, skewness, kurtosis, jarque-bera test and durbin-watson test were briefly mentioned.
"
108,"multiple-linear-regression (mlr) has a closed-form-solution but is impractical due to matrix-inversion difficulties and multi-collinearity.  feature-selection involves removing features with p-values greater than 0.05. data-splitting, typically 80-20% (training-test), is crucial for model-evaluation and preventing overfitting; the ratio depends on sample-size.  overfitting occurs when training-r-squared is significantly higher than testing-r-squared.  multiple-r is the square-root of r-squared, representing the correlation between the dependent-variable and all independent-variables. adjusted-r-squared accounts for the number of variables, providing a better measure of model-fit.  the total-sum-of-squares (tss) uses n-1 degrees-of-freedom because calculating the mean consumes one degree-of-freedom. linear-regression does not always produce a straight-line; it models linear-combinations of independent-variables. parametric-models (slr, mlr) utilize p-values, while non-parametric-models (decision-trees, random-forests) rely on metrics like r-squared and mean-squared-error (mse).  python-libraries like sklearn and statsmodels.api are used for mlr implementation.  sklearn facilitates model-building and prediction, but statsmodels provides more detailed statistical-analysis, including aic, bic, omnibus-statistic, omnibus-p-value, jarque-bera-test, and durbin-watson-test, for assessing model-fit and normality-of-residuals. quantile-quantile (q-q) plots visually assess whether residuals are normally-distributed.  the 95%-confidence-interval for beta1 indicates the likely range of a predictor's coefficient.  data-drift refers to changes in data-patterns over time, necessitating model-updates.  intra-model and inter-model error interpretations were also discussed, along with handling non-linearity using mlr.  the bias-variance-tradeoff was mentioned in relation to overfitting.  ordinary least squares (ols) is a method used for mlr.  area-under-the-curve and probability-of-a-specific-value were also briefly introduced.
